# Introduction

The following section contains documentation on the foundational concepts of KlayOracle. The information on these pages will provide you with a better understanding of how KlayOracle operates, both from a user perspective and under the hood.

This is the section where you can learn about setting up and operating a KlayOracle node and data provider, as well as understanding their roles within the network. This section is especially helpful for individuals contributing to the KlayOracle [open-source codebase](https://github.com/KlayOracle/klayoracle-monorepo).

For instance, the pages in this section offer guidance on the underlying structure of KlayOracle nodes and data providers, how to locally execute them through command line options, and create secure connections between them.

Additionally, there is a page dedicated to security practices, which can help protect your nodes and data providers against malicious attacks.

### Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

In order to get the most value from the tutorials on this page, the following skills are necessary:

* Understanding what a blockchain oracle is
* Basic knowledge about blockchain architecture and smart contracts
* Basic knowledge about HTTP, JSON and SSL
* Experience using the command line

Users that need to revisit these fundamentals can find helpful resources relating to blockchain oracles here and here, blockchain architecture here, and smart contracts here. Information on HTTP can be found here, while SSL and JSON are covered here and here respectively. This guide contains help tips on getting started with the command line.
